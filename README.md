## Introduction ##
Every business today is going through a digital transformation due to disruptive forces in the market, from born-in-the-cloud competitors to the increasing demands of customers, partners and employees to engage through modern digital experiences. They are evolving from relying only on historical data to learning to use both historical and real-time data to drive innovation, evolve business strategy and automate critical business processes.

As businesses evolve and transform to take advantage of real-time data, they will drive impact through operational efficiencies as well as create new revenue opportunities. For example, a product manufacturer can gather information about how their products in remote locations are performing and automate the scheduling of field service engineers only as needed. Retail outlets can provide real-time inventory to drive an Omni-channel shopping experience for their customers.  Companies that have a need to increase worker safety can track both environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and wind speed along with employee biometrics such as heartrate, body temperature and breathing rate to be able to determine if an employee’s physical condition would create a worker safety issue. 

In each of these scenarios, companies are finding that to stay competitive, improve operational efficiencies and engage their customers more deeply, they must learn to leverage modern software development patterns and practices. They are transforming to become Software-as-a-Service providers skilled in the dark arts of data science and Internet of Things(IoT). They are learning to create applications that connect people, places and things. They are providing real-time data visualization, alerts and notifications. They are integrating these connected products with existing line of business systems and providing seamless authentication for customers, partners and employees through immersive, beautiful experiences that work on any device and are available 24/7. They are transforming to become a Real-Time Business.

## About this book ##
This book outlines a vision for how today’s businesses can transform themselves by leveraging real-time data and advanced machine learning analytics, evolving from reactive to proactive customer care using remote monitoring, real-time inventory, location awareness, predictive maintenance and rich data visualizations.

Business in Real-Time Using Azure IoT and Cortana Analytics provides prescriptive guidance for architects and developers on the design and development of modern Internet of Things (IoT) and Advanced Analytics solutions. In addition, this book offers patterns and practices for those looking to engage their customers and partners through Software-as-a-Service solutions that work on any device.

Whether you are working in Health & Life Sciences, Manufacturing, Retail, Smart Cities and Buildings or Process Control, there exists a common platform from which you can create your targeted vertical solutions. Using a reference architecture as a road map and building on Azure’s PaaS services, a solution architecture unfolds that demonstrates a complete end-to-end IoT and Advanced Analytics scenario.

## Getting Started ##

This code repository provides a foundation for the exercises in chapters 2 through 10. By following along with the exercises, you are able to create a running example of an IoT and advanced analytics solution. While it is not a complete solution, it provides you hands-on experience with Azure PaaS services for IoT and analytics as well as the patterns that are common in these highly-distributed, multi-tenant SaaS solutions.
