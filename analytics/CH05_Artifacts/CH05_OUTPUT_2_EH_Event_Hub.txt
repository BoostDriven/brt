Note:
This will be ADDED to the solution in Chapter 9.

The EH Data structure is defined in the ASA Query:
-- ****************************
-- * HOTPATH - OUTPUT to Event Hub 
-- * If Machine Learning Predicts Stress
-- ***************************
SELECT  
        SQ.[Timestamp]as [timerstamp], 
        RF.username,
        AD.phone as [adminphone],
        AD.email as [adminemail]

INTO [output-EH]
FROM subquery SQ

JOIN [input-refdata-team] RF
	ON SQ.UserId = RF.id
   
JOIN [input-refdata-team] AD
     ON RF.companyname = AD.companyname

WHERE   SQ.result.[Scored labels] = 'Y'
        AND AD.type = '2'
