# The next three lines get the feature columns and the label column from the dataset, 
# and combine them into a new R data frame that is named train.data:
features <- get.feature.columns(dataset)
labels   <- as.factor(get.label.column(dataset))
train.data <- data.frame(features, labels)

# The predefined function, get.feature.columns(), selects the columns that were designated as features in the metadata for dataset.
feature.names <- get.feature.column.names(dataset)

# the predefined function, get.feature.column.names(dataset), is used to get feature column names from the dataset. Those names are designated
# as the names for columns in train.data.
# a temporary name Class is created for the label column.
names(train.data) <- c(feature.names, "Class")

# Train the "Naïve Bayes" classifier algorithm by using the labels and features in the train.data data frame.
model <- naiveBayes(Class ~ ., train.data)
